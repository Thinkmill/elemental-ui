# A11y

The components within this design system have been implemented with
accessibility built in. This package aims to provide helpers for other
occasions.

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from '@elemental-ui/a11y';
```

## Visually Hidden

Content which should be visually hidden, but remain accessible to assistive
technologies such as screen readers, can be styled using `VisuallyHidden`.

This can be useful in situations where additional visual information or cues
(such as meaning denoted through the use of icons or colour) need to also be
conveyed to non-visual users.
